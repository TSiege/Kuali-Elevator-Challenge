// What objects should their be?
// elevators, yes
// elevator operator? probs
// floors? not sure how else to call the operator or elevator?
// building? does a building have them all?
// building has floors, elevators, and elevator operator
// building could instantiate them all
//   building knows how many floors and elevators
// floors could call operator,
// operator sends elevator to floor,
// elevator goes to floor
// needs an event loop of some sort
